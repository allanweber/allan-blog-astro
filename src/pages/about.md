A creative, fullstack developer who possesses strong technical knowledge and delivers solid, reliable and scalable software.

I am a very adapt developer with over 15 years of experience with backend, frontend, architecture and devops applications.

As a Senior Developer, I have helped several companies to improve their development process and create software with high value and quality.

I always take the ownership in the projects I am working, but for that, I need to not only like what I am doing but also believe in the project and company.

I love to lead the adoption of new technologies, helping my team to be more efficient and have more performance.

Agile and Scrum techniques are very important to me, such as sprint planning, sprint review and sprint retrospective, always trying to remove any kind issues or impediments.

Team player is one of my main characteristics, not only to get things done but also to enjoy free time with my teammates, during lunch or any happy hour.
