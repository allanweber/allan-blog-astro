## Table of contents

## Status Quo

After more than 15 years working as a developer, I decided to start writing blog posts. I have been thinking about it for a long time, but I never had the courage to start. I always thought that I was not good enough to write, that I would not be able to write something that would be interesting to someone. But I realized that I was wrong. I have a lot of experience and knowledge to share, and I can help many people with my posts.

## Why I decided to start writing

Even if I don't have the best writing skills, or the most interesting topics to write about, I will start writing for myself. I will write about what I like, what I know, and what I want to learn. I will write about my experiences, my projects, my thoughts, and my opinions. I will write about what I think is important, and what I think can help others.

Even if doesn't help anyone, it is journal of my life, my thoughts, my experiences, and my knowledge, I can even use as a quick reference to some topics.

## What I will write about

I will write about software development, programming languages, frameworks, libraries, tools, methodologies, best practices, blablablabla.
NO. I won't write about that.

No bullshit, no clickbait, no fake news, no fake promises, no fake anything.

I will write about real shit, real problems, real solutions, real software.

Not all that delusion about perfection, 100% code coverage or that tool/libraries/frameworks that none uses in the real world.

Things that I am going to do for sure:

* Small posts about a useful library or code snippet.
* I will start a a couple of series about real applications step by step and document my journey building a micro-saas.
* I will build small applications for my day-to-day stuff, maybe some tools, maybe some data scrapping, definitely something related do DAY TRADE and STOCK investment.

See you there....
